- We need to cover all function in SUT.
- Contruct test case and excute those functions.
Advantages:
	- Give us object score.
	- When coverage is <100%, we are given meaningful tasks.
Disadvantage:
	- Not very helpful in finding errors of omission.
	- Hard to know what made test coverage score less than 100%
	- Some sofware would  require 100% test coverage.
	- 100% coverage doesn't mean all bugs were found.
