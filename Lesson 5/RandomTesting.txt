- Create many test case with test case generator, with the test case give us the output of SUT.
- The oracle determine if the output is good or bad (depends on if it passes whatever checks we have).
- If the output not okay, we save the test case somewhere for later inspection.
- Random testing is not necessarily part of the test suite for SUT. Can work independently.
- We need a random test case generator and good oracle.
